AudioKit V3 Development
=======================

This repo is for the development of AudioKit Version 3, powered by Soundpipe, and taking advantage of advantages in the Swift Language.

The first project is the "Initial Proof of Concept" and it is simply an OSX Command line app that runs Soundpipe via AudioKit-esque Objective-C classes.
