summary: Reverberates an input signal with a “colored” frequency response

shortDescription: filter

description:
 This filter reiterates input with an echo density determined by loopDuration.
 The attenuation rate is independent and is determined by reverbDuration, the
 reverberation duration (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000,
 or 60dB down from its original amplitude). Output from a comb filter will appear
 only after loopDuration seconds.

inputs:
- source: {
  audioKitName: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- revtime: {
  audioKitName: reverbDuration,
  comment: "The time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB from its original amplitude. (aka RT-60).",
  default: 1
}

constants:
- looptime: {
  audioKitName: loopDuration,
  comment: "The loop time of the filter, in seconds. This can also be thought of as the delay time. Determines frequency response curve, loopDuration * sr/2 peaks spaced evenly between 0 and sr/2.",
  default: 0.1
