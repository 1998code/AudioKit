operation: AKOscillator

summary: A simple oscillator with linear interpolation.

shortDescription: oscillator

description:
 Reads from the table sequentially and repeatedly at given frequency.
 Linear interpolation is applied for table look up from internal phase values.

tables:

  audioKitName: waveform,
  comment: "Shape of the table to oscillate.",
  default: sine
}

parameters:
- freq: {
	audioKitName: frequency,
	comment: "Frequency in cycles per second",
	default: 440
}
- amp: {
	audioKitName: amplitude,
	comment: "Amplitude of the output",
	default: 1
}

constants:
- iphs: {
	audioKitName: phase,
	comment: "Initial phase of waveform in functionTable, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1).",
