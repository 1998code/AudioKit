node: AKOscillator

summary: A simple oscillator with linear interpolation.

four-letter-code: oscl

one-word-description: oscillator

type: generator

description:
 Reads from the table sequentially and repeatedly at given frequency.
 Linear interpolation is applied for table look up from internal phase values.
