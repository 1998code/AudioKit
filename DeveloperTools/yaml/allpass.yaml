sp_name: allpass

operation: AKFlatFrequencyResponseReverb

summary: All-pass filter, often used for the creation of reverb modules.

shortDescription: reverb

description:
  This filter reiterates the input with an echo density determined by loop time. The attenuation rate is
   independent and is determined by the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to
    decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude).  Output will begin to appear immediately.

inputs:
- source: {
  audioKitName: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- revtime: {
  audioKitName: reverbDuration,
  comment: "The duration in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude.",
  default: 0.5
}

constants:
- looptime: {
  audioKitName: loopDuration,
  comment: "The loop duration of the filter, in seconds. This can also be thought of as the delay time or “echo density” of the reverberation.",
  default: 0.1
}
