sp_name: jitter

operation: AKJitter

summary: Generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated.

shortDescription: jitter

description:
  Produce a signal with random fluctuations (aka... jitter). This is useful for emulating jitter found in analogue equipment.

  This operation generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated inside the interval amplitude to -amplitude.
  Duration of each segment is a random value generated according to minimum and maximum frequency values.

  This can be used to make more natural and “analog-sounding” some static, dull sound.
  For best results, it is suggested to keep its amplitude moderate.
