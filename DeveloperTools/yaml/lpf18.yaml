description:
  3-pole (18 db/oct slope) Low-Pass filter with resonance and tanh distortion.

inputs:
- source: {
  ak-variable: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- dist: {
  ak-variable: distortion,
  comment: "Distortion amount.  Zero gives a clean output. Greater than zero adds tanh distortion controlled by the filter parameters, in such a way that both low cutoff and high resonance increase the distortion amount.",
  default: 0.5
}
- cutoff: {
  ak-variable: cutoffFrequency,
  comment: "Filter cutoff frequency, in Hertz",
  default: 1500
}
- res: {
  ak-variable: resonance,
  comment: "Resonance. Usually a value in the range 0-1. A value of 1.0 will self oscillate at the cutoff frequency. Values slightly greater than 1 are possible for more sustained oscillation and an “overdrive” effect.",
  default: 0.5
