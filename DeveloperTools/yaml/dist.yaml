inputs:
- source: {
  ak-variable: input,
  comment: "Input audio signal."
}

parameters:
- pregain: {
  ak-variable: pregain,
  comment: "Determines the amount of gain applied to the signal before waveshaping. A value of 1 gives slight distortion.",
  default: 2.0
}
- shape1: {
  ak-variable: postiveShapeParameter,
  comment: "Shape of the positive part of the signal. A value of 0 gets a flat clip.",
  default: 0
}
- shape2: {
  ak-variable: negativeShapeParameter,
  comment: "Like shape1, only for the negative part.",
  default: 0
}
- postgain: {
  ak-variable: postgain,
  comment: "Gain applied after waveshaping",
