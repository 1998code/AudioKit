/** Potential MIDI Status messages

 - NoteOff: something resembling a keyboard key release
 - NoteOn: triggered when a new note is created, or a keyboard key press
 - PolyphonicAftertouch: rare MIDI control on controllers in which every key has separate touch sensing
 - ControllerChange: wide range of control types including volume, expression, modulation and a host of unnamed controllers with numbers
 - ProgramChange: messages are associated with changing the basic character of the sound preset
 - ChannelAftertouch: single aftertouch for all notes on a given channel (most common aftertouch type in keyboards)
 - PitchWheel: common keyboard control that allow for a pitch to be bent up or down a given number of semitones
 - SystemCommand: differ from system to system
