//: # AudioKit for macOS Playgrounds
//:
//: AudioKit comes with many playgrounds, each of which serves to teach some
//: core concept, demonstrate a particular generator or synthesizer, or just
//: show off some wacky sounds that we've discovered.  Because there are so
//: many playgrounds that are inter-related in different ways, the order of the
//: playgrounds in Xcode is more or less alphabetical, however this index page
//: lists all the the playgrounds grouped by category.  Playgrounds that fit
//: into multiple categories are listed in each relevant category.
//:
//: ## Getting Started
//:
//: Let's start off just making sure you're all set up and can make sound.
