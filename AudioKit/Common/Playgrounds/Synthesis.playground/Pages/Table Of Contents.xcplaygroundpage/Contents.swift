//: # AudioKit for macOS Playgrounds
//:
//: AudioKit comes with many playgrounds, each of which serves to teach some
//: core concept, demonstrate a particular generator or synthesizer, or just
//: show off some wacky sounds that we've discovered.  Because there are so
//: many playgrounds that are inter-related in different ways, the order of the
//: playgrounds in Xcode is more or less alphabetical, however this index page
//: lists all the the playgrounds grouped by category.  Playgrounds that fit
//: into multiple categories are listed in each relevant category.
//:
//: ## Getting Started
//:
//: Let's start off just making sure you're all set up and can make sound.
//:
//: * [Introduction and Hello World](Introduction%20and%20Hello%20World)
//:
//: ## This is going to be fun...
//:
//: So wait, before we jump into the actual tutorials, let's just highlight some
//: of the cooler sound playgrounds we have.  Don't try to understand the code
//: if you're just started, it will all be expained starting with the next section,
//: Basic Tutorials.
//:
//: * [Electro Drum Beat](Drum%20Synthesizers)
//: * [Alien Apocalypse](Linear%20and%20Exponential%20Segment%20Operations)
//: * [Telephone](Telephone) - Dialtone, ringing, busy signal, and digits
//: * [Newton's Cradle](Newtons%20Cradle)
//: * [Metronome](Metronome)
//: * [XY Pad](XY%20Pad)
//:
//: ## Designing Sound
//:
//: These playgrounds are inspired by the "Practicals" section of the book
//: "Designing Sound", by Andy Farnell.  While this book is excellent, the
//: examples are implemented in Pd, which is okay, I guess, but hey, this is AudioKit!
//:
//: * [Pedestrians](Pedestrians)
//: * [Telephone](Telephone) - Dialtone, ringing, busy signal, and digits
//:
//: Hopefully we'll add more practicals over time.  If you're interested in
//: making more, submit a pull-request to git repo and we'll be sure to include them.
//:
//: ## Generator Nodes
//:
//: ### Oscillators
//:
//: Oscillators are the bread and butter of audio synthesis and there's no
//: shortage of them in AudioKit.
//:
//: * [Simple Oscillator](Simple%20Oscillator)
//: * [FM Oscillator](FM%20Oscillator)
//: * [General Purpose Oscillator](General%20Purpose%20Oscillator)
//: * [Morphing Oscillator](Morphing%20Oscillator)
//: * [Sawtooth Oscillator](Sawtooth%20Oscillator)
//: * [Square Wave Oscillator](Square%20Wave%20Oscillator)
//: * [Triangular Wave Oscillator](Triangular%20Wave%20Oscillator)
//:
//: ### Noise Generators
//:
//: Two noise "colors" to start off with, but we aim to have a much larger spectrum soon.
//:
//: * [Pink Noise Generator](Pink%20Noise%20Generator)
//: * [White Noise Generator](White%20Noise%20Generator)
//:
//: ### Physical Models
//:
//: There are only a few of these to start off with, but we think they are a
//: lot of fun and sound really good.  More on the way!
//:
//: * [Drawbar Organ](Drawbar%20Organ)
//: * [Dripping Sounds](Dripping%20Sounds)
//: * [Plucked String](Plucked%20String)
//: * [Mandolin](Mandolin)
//: * [Flute](Flute)
//:
//: ## Operations
//:
//: Operations are used to make the internals of a single node.
//:
//: * [Custom Generator](Custom%20Generator)
//: * [Low-Frequency Oscillating of Parameters](Low-Frequency%20Oscillating%20of%20Parameters)
//: * [Using Functions](Using%20Functions)
//: * [Using Functions Part 2](Using%20Functions%20Part%202)
//: * [Noise Operations](Noise%20Operations)
//:
//: Many of the types of things you can do in nodes are also possible with operations,
//: but with great flexibility in how the parameters are changed over time.
//:
//: * [Bit Crush](Bit%20Crush%20Operation)
//: * [Drum Synthesizers](Drum%20Synthesizers)
//: * [FM Oscillator](FM%20Oscillator%20Operation)
//: * [Linear and Exponential Segment Operations](Linear%20and%20Exponential%20Segment%20Operations)
//: * [Noise](Noise%20Operations)
//: * [Phasor](Phasor%20Operation)
//: * [Plucked String Operation](Plucked%20String%20Operation)
//: * [Sawtooth Wave Oscillator Operation](Sawtooth%20Wave%20Oscillator%20Operation)
//:
//: ## Sporth
//:
//: Sporth is a simple but super-powerful stack-based audio processing language
//: that you can run directly in AudioKit. Here are some examples.
//:
//: * [Sporth Based Generator](Sporth%20Based%20Generator)
//:
//: ## Development
//:
//: These playgrounds are here basically for us to work on future AudioKit developments.
//: Proceed with caution!
//:

//:
//: Hey you got all the way to the bottom of this file, why not let us know by
//: emailing audiokit@audiokit.io.  We'd love to hear from you!
