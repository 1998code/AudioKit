/// This is was built using the JC reverb implentation found in FAUST.
/// According to the source code, the specifications for this implementation were
/// found on an old SAIL DART backup tape.
/// 
/// This class is derived from the CLM JCRev function, which is based on the use of
/// networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters.  This class implements three series
/// allpass units, followed by four parallel comb filters, and two decorrelation delay lines in
/// parallel at the output.
