# Frequently Asked Questions about AudioKit

## Does AudioKit do beat/onset/tempo detection?

No, but we've built projects with AudioKit, integrating it with other libraries. Here are some resources:

* [Essentia - Open-source library and tools for audio and music analysis, description and synthesis](http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/)
* [Gist - An Audio Analysis Library](https://github.com/adamstark/Gist)
* [GistSwift - A Swift wrapper for Gist](https://github.com/dylan/GistSwift)

## Does AudioKit do chord or polyphonic pitch detection? 

No, it does not but we would love for it have that capability. If you know of a good open source algorithm that we could implement, there are several people on AudioKit's core team that would work on integrating that into AudioKit.

## How do you make money off of AudioKit / do you do consulting?

AudioKit is free, open-source, and always will be. Members of AudioKit's core team do consulting so you can inquire about contracting with or hiring one of us.
