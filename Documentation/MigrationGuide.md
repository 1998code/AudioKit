# AudioKit Migration Guide

This document was only begun for AudioKit 4.1, but it should be kept to date from here on.

## AudioKit 4.0.x to AudioKit 4.1

More To Come

## AudioKit 3 to AudioKit 4

AudioKit 4 was more of a feature set upgrade than any major changes that would affect currently running code.
Part of the reason for this was that some major updates were postponed until Version 4.1.

## AudioKit 2.x to AudioKit 3+

AudioKit 3 was a complete rewrite from AudioKit 2, using a different audio engine internally, so 
there is no migration path between these two versions.
