# AudioKit 

AudioKit is not just one thing any more, it is an entire audio development ecosystem of code repositories, packages, libraries, algorithms, applications, playgorunds, tests, and scripts, built and used by a community of audio programmers, app developers, engineers, researchers, scientists, musicians, gamers, and kids.

AudioKit has several underlying goals that motivate its development.

1. First, we hope that learning to program with AudioKit is easy for anybody. In order to get people started we provide Swift Playgrounds, demonstration applications, and access to a supportive Slack group of AudioKit Professionals.

2. Next, we want AudioKit to be extensible to allow more advanced developers to create their own custom apps and libraries built on top of AudioKit. Most of what used to be part of AudioKit has been moved to separate packages to ensure AudioKit is extensible and to give developers several examples of different approaches to extending AudioKit.

3. An important goal for AudioKit is to allow it to grow and be maintainable by a handful of volunteers. For this reason we have extensive tests that are run whenever changes are made to any AudioKit code repository. We accept and encourage Github sponsorship of the people who spend a lot of time supporting AudioKit.

4. We want to inspire the next generation of audio app developers and we do that by highlighting AudioKit-powered apps and by creating our own apps under the "AudioKit Pro" brand including the world's most downloaded synth "AudioKit Synth One" and a host of other AudioKit Pro apps.

## Examples

The primary source for AudioKit examples is the [AudioKit Cookbook](https://github.com/AudioKit/Cookbook). This app contains all of the mini-examples that used to be included with AudioKit.

Larger examples have been moved to their own repositories:

* [Analog Synth X](https://github.com/AudioKit/AnalogSynthX)
* [AudioKit Synth One](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKitSynthOne)
* [Audio Unit Manager](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioUnitManager)
* [File Converter](https://github.com/AudioKit/FileConverter) - Updated for AudioKit 5
* [Flanger and Chorus](https://github.com/AudioKit/FlangerAndChorus) - Updated for AudioKit 5
* [MIDI File Edit And Sync](https://github.com/AudioKit/MIDIFileEditAndSync)

 ## Github Wiki 

AudioKit's inline comments are processed by [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc) and automatically create documentation on [AudioKit's Github Wiki](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/wiki).

## Migration Guide

The [Migration Guide](MigrationGuide-4.x-to-5.0.md) contains a lot of good information on converting your app from Version 4 to 5.
