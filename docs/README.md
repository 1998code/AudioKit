AudioKit Documentation
======================

AudioKit is documented in a few different, but related ways.

 Github Wiki 
 -------------

AudioKit's inline comments are processed by [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc) and automatically create documentation on [AudioKit's Github Wiki](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/wiki).

Migration Guide
-------------------

The [Migration Guide](MigrationGuide-4.x-to-5.0.md) contains a lot of good information on converting your app from Version 4 to 5.
