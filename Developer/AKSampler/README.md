# Developer/AKSampler 
Experimental projects to re-target the device-independent **AudioKitCore::Sampler** as an Audio Unit plug-in for use in a Mac DAW such as *Logic Pro X*.

At this point, there is only only one project, which creates a simple plugin based on the older AU version 2 standard, which remains the most widely-used plugin format on the Mac platform.
